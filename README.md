# Seat Yourself

### Made for:
Seat Yourself was the first group project assigned during a Web Development Immersive course at [Bitmaker (GA Toronto)](http://bitmaker.co) in February 2017.


### Made because:
We were asked to replicate the popular reservation-making app Open Table to practice app development skills learned to date (planning, data modelling, git, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, etc.) during 3 days of collaborative work.


### Made with:
Ruby on Rails, SCSS, PostgreSQL


### Made by:
This was a joint effort by Team Lone Panda: myself, [@badsubject](https://github.com/badsubject), [@claileslie](https://github.com/claileslie), and [@steph-wu](https://github.com/steph-wu)
